- Attack Speed and Accuracy Rating are very important for this build

#### [Crafting the bow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n8260_VEVhw)
##### Essence Crafting
- Shrieking Essence (+2 Skill Gems) until you hit Attack Speed T2+ and
- Open Suffix, Open Prefix
- Craft Cannot Roll Attack Mods - cost 1 Exalted
- Need to exalt the bow
	- Leo Research Exalt (level Leo to L3 (need) + Research Safehouse)
	- Use an Exalt Orb -> Only mod left is +1 socketed gems
- put Short Bow on the Item Filter (because it doesn't drop that much)
	- Preferrably short bow because of the low lvl requirement -> makes it easier to get off colors
##### Fossils crafting
- Needs to be above level 64 with Fossils or it cannot work
- Metallic + Corroded + Jagged
	- 1 in 4 chances of getting +3 Skill Gems
	- Keep doing it until you get Attack Speed (1 in 40-50 crafts)
	- *replace* Jagged with Shuddering and you get Attack Speed faster
		- Shuddering is more expensive

- **Check**: Minion Attack Speed also applies to you Node?
- Bows Fire an additional Arrow is not always good for the build
	- you always want to have an odd # of arrows (1, 3, 5)
	- if you get an even amount of arrows (2, 4, 6) then you fire in a V, bypasses the enemies

- **Katarina** up to **Level 4** can give you up to **6 White Sockets**!!!
- You can replace LE Damage For Attacks with Hypothermia
- Replace Inspiration with Deadly Ailments
